# willamettepiano-server

This is a small informational website built with React and Express. The react client, built using the create-react-app ("CRA") tool, is in the 'react-build' directory. The client souce code is not present in this repository--the static client build was created using the 'npm run build' included in CRA and copied into this server project.

## To Run ##

Clone the repo and 'npm install' to install dependencies. 'npm start' or 'node ./bin/www' to start server.
